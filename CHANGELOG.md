# Changelog

All notable changes to Impasse are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for its schemas and skill.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Schemas: `reviewer-response.v1.json` and `reconciliation-result.v1.json` — the
  reviewer emits observations with anchored evidence; reconciliation records the
  per-finding disposition and inline escalated deadlocks. Domain-general via an
  evidence *anchor* union (`file_range | text_quote | section | structured_path |
  generic`) plus an optional `external_source` citation. Invariants are enforced
  (evidence needs anchor+observation; approve ⇒ 0 findings; failed ⇒ failure object).
- Stdlib-only helpers under `scripts/`:
  - `impasse_lib.py` — config dir, cross-platform codex resolution, artifact hashing,
    endpoint normalization.
  - `impasse_consent.py` — block-by-default data-boundary consent, keyed to the
    normalized endpoint (a changed destination re-prompts), with a payload manifest
    and atomic consent-file writes.
  - `impasse_run.py` — supervised reviewer invocation: stdin-EOF, wall + idle
    timeouts, POSIX process-group termination with bounded reap, size-capped capture,
    and JSON/shape classification of reviewer output (never reports failure as success).
    Reliable process-group kill is POSIX-only; Windows is a roadmap.
